			<h1>Adam Bullied</h1>
			<p>Adam is a Game Director at Relic and works with a team of creative minds to incubate ideas for new games. (He’s pretty certain that it is the best job that a person can have.) Adam’s career in games all started when he was eleven years old, when he came across Bladerunner and Dungeons & Dragons at a local sci-fi convention. Although he didn’t understand either, he was captivated, bought his first Dungeons & Dragons set shortly thereafter and hasn’t stopped playing since. After studying film at Simon Fraser University, he taught himself early 3D software and got a job in the videogame industry at Radical Entertainment. Although it was intended to be temporary to pay off some student debt, he never managed to leave games; and at this point he doesn't think he’s qualified to do anything else</p>

	 		<h2>Ruination</h2>
	 		<h3>Created by: Dylan Rimmer</h3>
	 		<p>Ruination is a 2.5D side-scroller perspective game in which the player takes control of two characters with unique abilities and must solve various puzzles and traverse obstacles.

	 		<h2>Blind</h2>
	 		<h3>Created by: Clinton Walsh</h3>
	 		<p>This game is only possible because of the next-gen game engines that provide the raw horsepower needed to create this world. You travel from distant mountain tops to deep dark caves and barren deserts, all in one continuous world with no loading. And you do all this with one unique caveat… you’re blind.</p>

	 		<h2>Nerine</h2>
	 		<h3>Created by: Chris Truong, Amy Truong</h3>
	 		<p>Nerine is a science fiction survival horror narrative that takes place in the early 2060s in an alternate universe where NASA’s Constellation Program was not cancelled. The Constellation Program is a human spaceflight program that had clearly laid out plans to send humans to populate the moon, Mars, and eventually other planets. In this reality, the lunar colony has already been well-established, and Mars has a decade old fledgling colony that has, up till the beginning of Nerine, been thriving.</p>

	 		<h2>Revengening</h2>
	 		<h3>Created by: Hark Chhina, Darren Macphail, Clinton Walsh</h3>
	 		<p>Revenging is a top down stealth action game that requires players to successfully navigate through seven different levels and avoid detection by patrolling enemies. Being played from a top down perspective players can view the entirety of a level screen all at once including enemies, obstacles and the exit door. This is important as our game requires players to avoid each enemies’ line of sight using obstacles as cover or by attacking with punches to either kill enemies or to knock them out. An unconscious enemy can wake up over time while killed enemies are down for good.</p>
