		<p>The AFK (Away From Keyboard) game development symposium is an event designed to provide passionate SIAT undergraduate game design students with a chance to showcase their work to an industry audience. Students are encouraged to submit their game development projects to one of the four event categories listed below. From each category one project will be selected to present their work for feedback from a panel of five Vancouver games industry judges, as well as an audience of attendees. Selected students are also invited to the post-event mixer for a chance to network with Vancouver game industry officials and jumpstart their careers.

In addition to student projects the symposium will also feature two talks delivered by SIAT PhD faculty. These talks will focus on the speakers academic research involving expanding video games into areas beyond traditional entertainment. Free registration is required to attend as space is limited.

				<h2>Level Design Category:</h2>
				<p>Ruination is a 2.5D side-scroller perspective game in which the player takes control of two characters with unique abilities and must solve various puzzles and traverse obstacles. The player will have to switch between the two characters and use their abilities of shooting and super jumping in order to solve the various puzzles and proceed through the game's narrative.</p>

				<h2>Immersion Category:</h2>
				<p>This game is only possible because of the next-gen game engines that provide the raw horsepower needed to create this world. You travel from distant mountain tops to deep dark caves and barren deserts, all in one continuous world with no loading. And you do all this with one unique caveat… you’re blind. </p>

				<h2>Narrative Category:</h2>
				<p> Nerine is a science fiction survival horror narrative that takes place in the early 2060s in an alternate universe where NASA’s Constellation Program was not cancelled. The Constellation Program is a human spaceflight program that had clearly laid out plans to send humans to populate the moon, Mars, and eventually other planets. In this reality, the lunar colony has already been well-established, and Mars has a decade old fledgling colony that has, up till the beginning of Nerine, been thriving.</p>

				<h2>Artificial Intelligence Category:</h2>
                    <p>Revenging is a top down stealth action game that requires players to successfully navigate through seven different levels and avoid detection by patrolling enemies. Being played from a top down perspective players can view the entirety of a level screen all at once including enemies, obstacles and the exit door. This is important as our game requires players to avoid each enemies’ line of sight using obstacles as cover or by attacking with punches to either kill enemies or to knock them out. An unconscious enemy can wake up over time while killed enemies are down for good.</p>
