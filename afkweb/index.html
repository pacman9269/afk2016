        <p>The AFK (Away From Keyboard) game development symposium is an event designed to provide passionate SIAT undergraduate game design students with a chance to showcase their work to an industry audience. Students are encouraged to submit their game development projects to one of the four event categories listed below. From each category one project will be selected to present their work for feedback from  a panel of five Vancouver games industry judges, as well as an audience of attendees. Selected students are also invited to the post-event mixer for a chance to network with Vancouver game industry officials and jumpstart their careers.</p>
        <p>In addition to student projects the symposium will also feature two talks delivered by SIAT PhD faculty. These talks will focus on the speakers academic research involving expanding video games into areas beyond traditional entertainment. Free registration is required to attend as space is limited.

                <p>Narratively focused games are those that prioritize an engaging story above other aspects. There are various ways in which these games dictate the story and they each have various strengths and weaknesses. Game stories can be linear or branching, overt or subtle, long or short. Here are just a few examples of different forms that game narratives can take.</p>
                <p>The Uncharted series from Naughty Dog tells a very cinematic story inspired by films and television. Play is often interrupted so that the player can view cut scenes, and there are many instances of in game dialogue where your character interacts with others. This method allows the creators to tell an interested and highly focused story, but it doesn’t do a great job of leveraging the unique capabilities of games.</p>
                <p>Dark Souls’ intricate story is mostly contained in item descriptions and level design. Other than a few cut scenes at the beginning of the game there is very little dialogue or narration. Many players can miss the story entirely on their first play through as it isn’t in obvious places. A lot of the finer points have only really come to light through the combined efforts of dedicated players.</p>
                <p>Another increasingly popular trend in narrative games is to limit the player’s interaction to walking and reading/listening. This style is exemplified in Dear Esther and The Stanley Parable. Often these games lack many of the gameplay features in more traditional game experiences, but their focus on writing and narration allow them to excel in these areas. Choices are often limited to where the player will walk and what they will look at, while a narrator tells a story or comments on their choices.</p>
                <p>We have always craved interesting narratives and characters, and games provide us with unique tools to deliver these to our audience. By placing them in a richly detailed world or surrounding them with memorable characters we can let them experience stories in a whole new way, and this has proven very successful for many developers.</p>

            <div id='theme' class='text'>
                <p>A possible design direction for a video game is to create an engaging world or environment. In another term, this is a focus on theme. Choosing a theme is very important in ensuring that all the elements of the game hold together. This includes the world’s space, lighting, and sound (music and special effects). Without a consistent theme, it breaks the player’s immersion and they ‘exit’ the game in their mind. As players we want to be as involved in the game as we can, and this is done when everything in the world makes sense (unless done purposely otherwise).</p>
                <p>Some of the example games that are successful with clear themes are Journey, the Bioshock series, the Dead Space series, the Mass Effect series, and Gone Home. The Bioshock games a strong example of theme based game design. The themes include an underwater city with tunnels that interconnect buildings and also an old American city that flies in the sky.</p>
                <p>Let us dig deeper into a category that is the underwater city of Bioshock. The era is an old American age, thus we see old typewriters or old style fashion clothing and such. The setting is an underwater city, thus the enemies have armors that is shaped like a submarine or diver costumes that fits the old American age. Other mentionable include the damp sound effects, the relatively dark lighting, and the overall atmosphere of the game that fit with a sunken city.</p>
                <p>All of the mentioned elements combined create one full immersive environment that will immerse gamers. One theory states the three steps of the immersion process of video games that are engagement, engrossment, and then immersion. Bioshock engages the gamers with introducing the plot of an underwater city with a few mechanics of the game. When the players became familiar enough with their surroundings, Bioshock engrosses them with the amazing interactive environments. This is done because the world that Bioshock offers continues to occupy the player’s mind with things to see, pick up, touch, interact, and destroy. The mechanics all relate to the theme of the game. At this state, the players become immersed, and it is the designers’ job to ensure the gamers stay in this state by pacing the assets that are given to players.</p>
                <p>All of the mentioned elements combined create one full immersive environment that will immerse gamers. The rest of the game elements in Bioshock were made to enhance the environment. The plots were created for us to pay attention in the details of our surroundings. In summary, their main theme is to have an astonishing space where everything else is implemented to support that theme. Designing for a specific theme can really clarify the goal that also set its boundaries and expectations for a clearer and better design.</p>

                <p>Focus on meaningful or emergent AI behavior through gameplay. Such behaviors might alter the
                gameplay or even the narrative throughout the game. A common method involves modifying AI behavior
                based on player actions. These actions include but are not limited to, players’ decisions throughout the
                game - the dialogue, the actions, if the player is active or idle. These AI algorithms are widely used in
                many different aspects inside a game. The most obvious being the controls of any NPCs (Non-playable characters) in the game. Path finding is also another common use for AI, especially in Strategy games; it is a method to determine how to get a character from one point on a map to another, taking the shortest path while considering all the obstacles and terrains.</p>
                <p>Starcraft 2 is a Real-Time Strategy game which involves gathering resources, training units and assault the enemy player(s) to achieve total conquest. In such game, micro management is very crucial to the chance of victory. The AI players in the game would employ scouts to gain insights on what the human players are building. If the human player let the AI player gain such insight, the AI player would begin to counter play the strategy. For example, if the AI detects that the human player is building air units, the AI player would start training anti-air units to counter play.</p>
                <p>Black &amp; White is a God simulation game where the player acts as a god and imposes their will on the residents of an island. It is up to the player to decide what actions to cast upon the islanders - be good, be evil or stay neutral. The player is never forced to do either good acts or evil acts by the game. The complex AI in the game is represented by the “Creature” that acts as the player’s pet. This creature can take in the form of an animal, and it learns its behaviors by mimicking the behaviors that of the player. The Creature’s behavior is programmed using the Belief-Desire-Intention Model based on work of Michael Bratman to simulate creative learning and decision making. It learns from player’s actions and can be corrected by the player as well - if the Creature does something that the player does not like, the player can choose to slap the Creature; if the Creature does something that the player desires, the player can choose to stroke the Creature, as a reward.</p>
                <p>Left 4 Dead 2 is a first person shooter, zombie survival game. In the game, four characters must work together to escape the zombie-infested city. The game supports up to 4 human players playing the game at the same time, if there isn’t 4 players, any missing players will be controlled by the AI. Also, if any players remain idle for a certain amount of time, the AI will also take over that character. The unique AI feature for this game, however, lies in the “Director” AI. The Director follows the characters as they progress throughout the level. The Director’s job is to monitor the performance of the players and adjust the game difficulty accordingly. This adjustment includes changing the equipment, wall placements, special zombie spawns and many more. So even if the player is very good at the game the Director would compensate by sending additional zombie waves at the players. This AI feature also keeps the players moving and engaged.</p>

            <div id='leveldesign' class='text'>
                <p>Level design in games is often a large contributing factor to other game focuses such as narrative or theme. A focus on strategic and intentional level design differs, as instead of highlighting positive aspects of other game components, strategic level design is an approach that involves how the player learns and experiences the game’s mechanics. Two prominent applications of strategic level design are: teaching game mechanics through level design, and designing levels with multiple solutions dependent on player preference.</p>
                <p>Super Meat Boy is a 2D side-scroller platformer game created by Team Meat. Super Meat Boy’s designer, Edmund McMillen, carefully crafted the first world of Super Meat Boy in such a way as to teach players the mechanics and limitations of the Meat Boy character through his level designs. A strong example of this is the level “The Gap” where the level’s only obstacle is a large gap between the player and their goal. The gap is designed in such a way that the only way for the player to reach the other side is to perform a “long jump” a mechanic achieved by jumping with the run button held down. McMillen felt that while he could have simply just displayed text telling the player how to run and jump, having the player learn for themselves creates a more lasting impression. While avoiding the possibility that a player may simply skip the instructional text and forget how to long jump, McMillen instead creates a scenario where the player is forced to solve the problem themselves and receive a sense of accomplishment, resulting in a higher likelihood of the player remembering the mechanic.</p>
                <p>In contrast, some games excel in having a number of possible solutions. Mark of the Ninja is a 2D stealth platformer game developed by the Vancouver game studio “Klei”. While Mark of the Ninja is defined as a stealth game, the game’s levels are designed in such a way that they can be completed through numerous approaches. For example, I might decide to complete a level by killing all of the enemies without attempting to hide myself, or, in contrast, I might decide to complete the level by sneaking past all of the guards without them ever being alerted that I was there. Mark of the Ninja supports this player preference gameplay with its scoring system, which awards the same number of points for sneaking by an enemy undetected as it does for killing an enemy. In summary, Mark of the Ninja’s strength in level design is shown in the player’s ability to see equal opportunity between a heavily guarded hallway and a lightly guarded ventilation shaft.</p>

                        games. (He’s pretty certain that it is the best job that a person can have.)
                        Adam’s career in games all started when he was eleven years old, when he came across Bladerunner
                        and Dungeons &amp; Dragons at a local sci-fi convention. Although he didn’t understand either, he was
                        captivated, bought his first Dungeons &amp; Dragons set shortly thereafter and hasn’t stopped playing since.
                        After studying film at Simon Fraser University, he taught himself early 3D software and got a job in the
                        videogame industry at Radical Entertainment. Although it was intended to be temporary to pay off some
                        student debt, he never managed to leave games; and at this point he doesn't think he’s qualified to do
                        anything else.

In this reality, the lunar colony has already been well-established, and Mars has a decade old fledgling colony that has, up till the beginning of Nerine, been thriving.</p>

                    <p>Revenging is a top down stealth action game that requires players to successfully navigate through seven different levels and avoid detection by patrolling enemies. Being played from a top down perspective players can view the entirety of a level screen all at once including enemies, obstacles and the exit door. This is important as our game requires players to avoid each enemies’ line of sight using obstacles as cover or by attacking with punches to either kill enemies or to knock them out. An unconscious enemy can wake up over time while killed enemies are down for good.</p>
