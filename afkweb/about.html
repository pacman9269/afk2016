                            <p>Sean is a 4th year undergraduate student within the design concentration of the SIAT program. He is a designer at heart with a working understanding of numerous programming languages. This blend of skills allows him to fit easily into a variety of project roles. During his time at SIAT, Sean discovered a deep passion for game design and development. This passion led him to transition from student to teacher as a teaching assistant for the “Foundations of Game Development” course. Feeling that the SIAT program should become more involved in the Vancouver gaming industry, he created the AFK Game Development Symposium.</p>
